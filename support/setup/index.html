		<h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
		<h4>Note: Do not plug the sensor in until you're ready to configure it</h4>
		<h4>Download the app</h4>
		<p>Download the "Jolt Sensor" app from the <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jolt-sensor/id1024700678?mt=8">App Store</a> (iOS) or <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joltsensor.app_android&hl=en">Google Play Store</a> (Android).</p>
		<h4>Create user account</h4>
		<p>Open the Jolt Sensor app and follow instructions for creating a user account and logging in. Once you are successfully logged in, click through the brief tutorial that appears to get you acquainted with the app's interfaces and functionality.</p>
		<h4>Plug in sensor</h4>
		<p>Remove the Jolt Sensor from its packaging, and use the included micro USB charging cable to connect the sensor to a power source, either through an FCC compliant AC USB power adapter or by plugging directly into a computer USB port. This will turn on the sensor for the first time, and the indicator light on the sensor will flash red to indicate that the unit is charging. Leave the sensor plugged in through the remainder of the setup process.</p>
		<h4>Configure the sensor</h4>
		<p>From the main "Dashboard" screen, click the "Add" button in the upper right and select "Create New Player" from the dropdown. Fill out the player profile biographical information and sports profiles. Then tap the "Add New Sensor" button to initiate configuration. When the process completes, select the "Create" button in the upper right to complete the configuration process.</p>
		<h4>Finish charging</h4>
		<p>Leave the unit plugged in until the red light stops blinking. This indicates that the device is fully charged. The device is now fully configured, fully charged, and ready to measure accelerations. The sensor is always on and logs all impact data onboard. To receive live data through the app, you must have Bluetooth enabled on your phone, with the Jolt Sensor app running in the background.</p>
		<h4>Read the manual</h4>
		<p>Now that you're up and running, it's a good idea to read the <a href="/support/manual">product manual</a> to further familiarize yourself with the product. If an issue arises, first reference the manual, and then check out our <a href="/support">support topics</a> for solutions and ways to contact us for additional help.</p>
