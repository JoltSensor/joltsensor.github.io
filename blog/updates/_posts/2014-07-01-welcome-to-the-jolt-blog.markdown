Welcome to the Jolt blog. We've been working hard over the course of the last year, and are nearly ready to bring Jolt to market. We've finally approached a point in our development process where we're comfortable being a little less "stealthy" about what we're doing. And the timing couldn't be better. In the coming months we'll be completing the MassChallenge accelerator in Boston, moving our headquarters to St. Louis for Arch Grants, and launching the 1st-generation Jolt Sensor. We look forward to sharing the details of our development process as we experience the challenges and excitement of our startup journey.

In addition to providing a resource to fellow entrpreneurs and others curious about our progress, we also intend to make this blog a resource for the latest news and research pertaining to head impacts and concussions in youth athletics. In the course of our research and development, we've found a lot of really good resources and information across the web that we'd like to share with you. In the future, we plan to (time permitting) devote an entire section of the site as a resource center, but for now, we'll pass along interesting and useful bits as we encounter them.
