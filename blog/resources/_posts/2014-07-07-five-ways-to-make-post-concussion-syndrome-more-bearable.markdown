If you Google “post concussion syndrome activities,” you will find lots of activities to avoid. Unfortunately, many normal fun activities can make symptoms worse. If having a concussion weren’t bad enough, now many of the fun activities your child typically enjoys are off-limits. We’ve created a list of some fun activities that shouldn’t make your child’s symptoms worse and will hopefully make the recovery process more enjoyable.

#Audiobooks
Audiobooks provide a great alternative to paperbacks because you can still get lost in a story without straining your brain with the act of reading. Remember to select books that don’t require lots of hard thought (think "Harry Potter" over "War and Peace"). There are lots of good places to find audiobooks, but I personally like [Audible](http://www.audible.com/). They even give you your first audiobook for free.
  
#Cooking and Baking
Cooking and baking can be great post-concussion activities because they aren’t overly stimulating, but they provide a sense of accomplishment and control during a time when it’s easy to feel helpless. Start with something simple and fun like [chocolate chip cookies](http://www.kevinandamanda.com/whatsnew/new-recipes/chocolate-chip-lava-cookies.html) and move up from there. 

#Arts and Crafts
This is a great one because there are so many varieties to try. Drawing, painting, collages, clay/plasticine, paper mache, and even knitting or crocheting. Try some of these arts and crafts out and see what works best for your child. Who knows? You may even discover an artistic streak you didn’t know was there! 

#Yoga
Many people find Yoga to be very soothing and helpful in treating post concussion syndrome. Chances are your child has never tried it before, but it’s really easy to get started and doesn’t require lots of flexibility or perfect balance. [Yoga Journal](http://www.yogajournal.com/) has lots of great resources for everyone from beginners to experts. 

#Soothing Nature Sounds
Sometimes during post concussion syndrome your child is going to want to do nothing but lie down. Lying in a dark silent room is no fun, but soft nature sounds can be very relaxing. I personally like rain sounds ([Rainy Mood](http://www.rainymood.com/)), but you can find lots of options here: [Calm Sound](http://www.calmsound.com)

It’s important to remember that everyone is different and activities that work well for some won’t work well for others. If any activity causes symptoms to get worse it should be stopped immediately.
