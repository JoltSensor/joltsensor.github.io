Concussions have been big news in recent week, between the NCAA releasing a new set of standards for sideline concussion evaluations and a federal judge approving the NFL concussion settlement. Throughout continous coverage of sports-related concussions football has been at the forefront of public discourse. But recent events at the World Cup have propelled soccer and its international governing body FIFA into the headlines.

To many unfamiliar with the mechanics and physiology of concussions, soccer seems an unlikely culprit. Although it can get rough, it is decidedly a non-contact sport. The athletes wear no helmets, and the only protective pads to speak of are worn on their shins. The sport, particularly on the international stage, has even drawn criticism for players grossly exagerating the small contact that does occur, "flopping" to the ground theatrically in the hopes of drawing a penalty.

However, this year's World Cup matches have shown a reality that many soccer players have long been familiar with -- soccer carries a clear and present risk of concussions. Whether it's a knee to the head, as Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira suffered in group play last month, or a head-to-head impact like Javier Mascherano's in yesterday's semi-final match, the possible modes of injury in soccer are numerous and all the more threatening given the lack of protective headgear.

The even more troubling reality, however, is the response that occurs when these injuries occur. Despite FIFA advocating a well-defined [Sport Concussion Assessment Tool](/assets/documents/SCAT3.pdf) in line with the [recommendations of the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport](/assets/documents/ZurichGuidelines2013.pdf) held in late 2012 in Zurich, it's clear from the cases of Pereira and Mascherano that FIFA does not practice what it preaches.

After being [struck by a knee in the side of his head](http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/world-cup-news-2014/alvaro-pereira-knocked-out-then-raring-to-go-20140620-zsfqt.html), Pereira lay unconscious on the pitch, as teammmates and doctors rushed to his aid. However, he was allowed to return to play within minutes, after staggering to his feet to argue with the team doctor that was calling for a substitution. And in the case of Mascherano, although he did not lose consciousness following [yesterday's aerial collision](http://www.espnfc.com/video/highlights/114/video/1942207/was-mascherano-treated-appropriately), he immediately held his head and staggered a few steps forward before falling to the turf, apparently unable to stand. He too was allowed to continue playing, despite less than three minutes of evaluation.

Concussions can sometimes be difficult to recognize and diagnose, as the symptoms sometimes do not present fully until some time after the impact. And there is a full-spectrum of post-concussion symptoms that vary in severity, with the milder ones potentially harder to recognize. Yesterday, and last month, there was no ambiguity in the immediate aftermath of the impacts. Loss of consciousness. Falling down. Lying on the ground. Clutching head. Dazed vacant look. These athletes were visibly injured and certainly not in the right state of mind to be making any decisions regarding their return to play. The failures by their coaches, team doctors, and officials to step in and take decisive action to ensure their health and safety is simply inexcusable.

Following yesterday's events, ESPN Analyst [Taylor Twellman wasted no time in explaining](http://www.espnfc.com/video/highlights/114/video/1942207/was-mascherano-treated-appropriately) everything that was so wrong with what he had just witnessed:

> Here is the issue -- and this is the second time in this World Cup that we’ve seen this -- FIFA is acting as if this is 1950. It’s barbaric treatment of players. It’s not the initial concussion, Bob. We know this. It’s the second hit. FIFA, Argentina, Uruguay, and all these teams that are having these players play after initial concussions -- they’re putting these players' lives in their hands because of second impact syndrome. It is mind-boggling to me that there is no independent -- independent of either team -- [physician] from FIFA on the sidelines to deal with brain injuries. It is ridiculous.

Having had his professional soccer career cut short by a serious concussion and the subsequent four year struggle with [post concussion syndrome](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-concussion-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20032705), Twellman knows first-hand just how debilitating sports-related concussions can be. Following his own experiences, he realized the need to support other athletes and their families going through what he had, and is a tireless champion in the concussion community through his non-profit, [ThinkTaylor](http://www.thinktaylor.org/index.html), that is dedicated to concussion awareness, recognition, and education.

Through the efforts of ThinkTaylor and numerous other concussion awareness and education programs across the world, progress is being made. As people learn more about concussions and how they work, more athletes are receiving proper care and attention in the critical moments following an injury. However, as evidenced by the events of this World Cup, it is clear that there is still a very real need for additional progress. Until we collectively learn to recognize that a game is never worth more than someone's well-being, there will still be work left to do.
