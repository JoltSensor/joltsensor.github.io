				<h2>ANY ATHLETE, ANY SPORT</h2>
				<p>Concussions can happen in any sport. That's why the Jolt Sensor works for all of them. Mounting it is as simple as clipping it to whatever you're already wearing on your head. It's so small and light, you barely notice it's there. And switching between sports is a breeze.</p>
