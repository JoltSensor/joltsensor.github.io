      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Mount the sensor to whatever you wear on your head. Its versatile patent-pending design means one sensor for all of your activities. Whether it's a sweatband, helmet, hairband, baseball cap, or wrestling headgear, the sensor can quickly and easily detach and re-mount for seamless transitions between sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the sensor registers head accelerations over a certain threshhold, it provides the athlete with immediate feedback through a gentle vibration. This helps to keep athletes more aware of their actions, and can help them adjust to a safer playing style.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the sensor registers an impact, it shares it with the connected mobile app in real-time, keeping parents, coaches, and trainers aware of what's happening. If a significant impact or string of impacts is detected, the sensor vibrates more strongly to alert the player, while the mobile app alerts those following from the sidelines that the athlete should be removed from play for a brief evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Symptoms identified in the evaluation, the results of the team's standard evaluation protocol, and the return to play decision can all be entered directly into the app, alongside the collected impact data. All of this data is securely stored in the cloud, allowing you access to a lifetime of data for your athlete.

        The Jolt Sensor is not a concussion diagnostic tool. Concussions can only be diagnosed by a trained medical professional. The Jolt Sensor provides an objective measure of the quantity and magnitude of accelerations experienced by a user's head. It is intended to direct athletes towards safer behaviors and more timely and informed medical assessment. Visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/concussion/sports/">CDC website</a> to learn more about what a concussion is, how it occurs, and proper treatment in the event of an injury.
