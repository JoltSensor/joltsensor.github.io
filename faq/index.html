		<h2>What is the Jolt Sensor?</h2>
		<p>It is a multi-sport head impact sensor. Its clip design is compatible with existing athletic equipment, allowing you to quickly and easily attach it to whatever you already wear on your head, from helmets to headbands and everything in between.</p>
		<h2>Does it need to be worn on my head?</h2>
		<p>Yes. The device needs to be worn on the head to properly measure your head’s acceleration. The closer/tighter it is worn to the head, the better the results. For example, wearing it on a skullcap underneath of a helmet will yield more accurate measurements than wearing it attached directly to the helmet.</p>
		<h2>What is it actually measuring? Will it only know if I’m hit directly in the head?</h2>
		<p>The Jolt Sensor measures acceleration, so it will register any time that a player’s head rapidly accelerates or decelerates. This means that direct hits to the head won’t be the only things that register. Anything that makes your head move (for example, getting hit hard in the chest, causing your head to whip) can be measured by the Jolt Sensor.</p>
		<h2>Can it diagnose concussions? If not, what’s the point?</h2>
		<p>No sensor can diagnose a concussion. Even many doctors diagnose concussions on a purely symptomatic basis, without an objective test for diagnosis or for tracking recovery. But, Jolt can help to make sure you are alerted anytime your athlete experiences a statistically significant hit. By ensuring timely removal from play and sideline evaluation, the risk of additional impacts and a more severe injury can be mitigated. Additionally, we can harness athlete data to provide powerful insights to parents, coaches, and players, enabling them to take proactive measures to minimize head impacts through safer playing styles, ultimately preventing avoidable concussions.</p>
		<h2>How does the sensor send alerts? Do I have to download data after the game?</h2>
		<p>The sensor communicates all data in real-time using Bluetooth Low Energy, so, if the sensor is in range, you should receive notifications in the mobile app as they happen. Even if your phone is not in range, the Jolt Sensor can store all data onboard and uses vibration to alert the player. If you reconnect with the sensor later, you are able to quickly and easily sync the missed data and alerts from sensor to your phone.</p>
		<h2>Is there a limit to how many sensors I can connect to with my phone?</h2>
		<p>No. Although most phones are traditionally limited in the number of Bluetooth connections that they can maintain at one time, our innovative patent-pending communication protocol allows you to track and follow an unlimited number of Jolt Sensors in real-time.</p>
		<h2>Is the synced data just stored on my phone? How do I back it up?</h2>
		<p>All data that passes through the app is synced to our secure cloud database. This means you have lifetime access to your data, no matter what happens to your phone. And, by anonymously aggregating and analyzing the data, Jolt is able to provide more powerful insights to everyone in our system.</p>
