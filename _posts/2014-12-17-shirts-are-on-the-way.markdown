While you all are enjoying the holiday season with friends and families, we hope we can bring you some more holiday cheer!

To all of our t-shirt backers: your shirts have shipped and the first ones should be arriving on December 22 or 23, with the rest arriving over the next few days. As your shirts arrive, throw them on, take a picture, and send it our way (via Facebook, Twitter, or email) for us to share with the world.

To everyone who elected to appear on the backer Wall of Fame: the wall is now up at joltsensor.com/walloffame! We've added a link to it from the Kickstarter icon near the bottom of our home page, and will be linking to it in some upcoming blog and social media posts, so rest assured that the world will know how awesome you are. And to those of you who tried to sneak jokes in for your names on the Wall of Fame... we noticed, we laughed, and we left them in.

To everyone getting/giving sensors: our progress on the manufacturing side remains on schedule, as we've been working very closely with all of our selected manufacturers, especially as we set up our injection mold tooling with our enclosure manufacturer. Here's a sneak peek inside the facility just a short ride down the road from our headquarters in St. Louis. We're looking forward to the day we back Ben's pickup into the loading bay to pick up our first batch of finished products!
