### Sprint Mobile Health Accelerator, powered by Techstars
Today we begin a three month long accelerator program in Kansas City. It’s a tremendous opportunity that will provide us access to an extensive network of experienced industry experts, and we look forward to benefitting from their collective experience with hardware, manufacturing and distribution, and mobile health technology. The program will challenge us to examine every aspect of our business, help us to skip over common mistakes that early stage companies make, and push us to lay the strongest possible foundation for continued growth and success. If you’re ever in Kansas City, drop us a line -- we’d love to meet you and show you around our work space.

### Our Team is Growing
We’re excited to welcome Jon Lin as the third member of the Jolt team. Seth and I have been friends with him since our time at MIT, and he brings a wealth of experience in software development and the startup world to bolster our existing expertise. Jon’s focus will be on the continued cross-platform development of our mobile applications and ensuring that they are supported by a robust and scalable back-end infrastructure. We’re currently interviewing additional candidates for a fourth position, and are excited to continue to grow the team over the coming months.

### Domestic Manufacturing Operations
As we mentioned in our previous update, we’re working with a company in St. Peters, MO to manufacture our enclosures, which will consist of an impact-resistant polycarbonate shell with a soft rubberized outer coating. Our injection mold tooling is in final production, and we’ll share pictures as soon as we’re able to produce our first batch of enclosures. We’ve also selected an electronics manufacturer in Jacksonville, IL to produce and populate our custom circuit boards. They have an excellent track record in the production of ruggedized electronics and will also be conformal coating our boards to add an extra layer of protection against dirt and moisture. We will be receiving our first batch of production quality boards from them by the end of the week.

### Delivery Timeline Updates
Our anticipated delivery schedule has some small changes from what we originally projected back in August. We now expect to ship most sensors in late May or early June. We’ve had some small timeline delays that stemmed from additional work that we did to update and improve our enclosure design to guarantee the best possible product for our backers, while also ensuring efficiency and scalability of our manufacturing operations. Our early backers will be most affected by this, as we had originally projected April delivery. Shipments to early bird backers will still be the first out the door, followed closely by all other shipments in the order that we originally projected. We’ll provide more specific anticipated delivery dates in future updates, as we’re able to lock down our production and delivery timeline.
