summary: "Building a hardware startup can be hard. But by choosing the right local partners we've built a foundation for success."

It's a common saying in the startup world that "hardware is hard". With longer development cycles and more intensive early capital needs, each product iteration has significant cost (and risk) in both time and money. Fortunately, the boom in accessible rapid prototyping services, including affordable 3D printing and quick-turn custom circuit boards, is making it quicker and easier for hardware startups to iterate their way to quality pre-production prototypes. For Jolt, these tighter development cycles allowed us to spend more time testing prototypes in real-world applications, while getting critical feedback from actual users.

Once we were happy with the product design and had validated early demand through our Kickstarter campaign, it was time to take the next step and start proper production of a consumer-quality product. The conventional wisdom that many shared with us was that overseas production would be a no-brainer. We were told that American manufacturers just wouldn't be able to compete on cost or be as readily scalable when it was time to grow the business. However, as we researched suppliers and third-party manufacturers we started to find that there were many local options that could compete on cost, had the capacity (and willingness) to grow with us, and were excited at the prospect of working with a local startup. And we found numerous benefits beyond cost and scalability.

#### Collaboration

Even though we had finalized most of our design by the time the Kickstarter ended, there was still a lot of work to be done in final design for manufacturing. By selecting partners near to our headquarters in St. Louis, we not only shared a common native language and time zone, but were also able to make frequent in-person visits. While there are numerous digital collaboration tools, we're firm believers that nothing beats face-to-face interactions. These meetings allowed us to make sure ... alignment, clarity, rapid brainstorming and problem solving.

#### Creativity

Meetings --> same page on motivations to balance quality and costs --> wanted to get creative to prove thier abilities to deliver and become a proof point of smart early stage manufacturing.

#### Community

Building relationships in local communities -- shining light on unknown operations -- strengthen the community as a whole
