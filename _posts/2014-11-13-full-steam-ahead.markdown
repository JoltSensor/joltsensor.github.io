It's been a while since our last update, as we've been working full steam ahead to set up our manufacturing lines and start delivering other rewards tiers. In consulting with injection molding facilities and working with all sorts of packaging samples, we've been making some small design updates that will result in an even higher quality product, while managing our costs and ensuring scalability of operations. And, we're excited that a majority of these operations will be completed near our headquarters in St. Louis and the surrounding suburbs, giving us hands-on contact and high visibility into day-to-day operations, while supporting local jobs and American manufacturing. We've also finalized our t-shirt designs, and, as soon as the last few surveys are completed (check your email inbox and spam folders if you missed the backer survey/haven't completed it yet), we can finalize the order with our printer, and the shirts will arrive at your homes about two weeks after that.

Before we share the designs for those shirts, we'd also like to share a slight rebranding effort that we just completed. We're still Jolt, but we've made some updates to our logo and branding to make it cleaner, bolder, and more memorable. In the graphic below, you can see the changes are subtle, but noticeable. The circular logo has been dilated down to maintain better clarity at small sizes, and the positive and negative spaces in it have been inverted. Coupled with an updated typeface, this is the new face of Jolt that will appear on your shirts and will be propagated to our website, social media pages, etc. in the coming weeks.

So, without further ado, here are the shirts that we'll soon be shipping out to everyone!

Through the coming weeks, we'll continue to share updates as we finalize manufacturing considerations (and will hopefully have some cool pictures of the manufacturing facilities, tooling, etc. to share). For those of you who haven't completed your backer surveys yet, please do so as soon as possible so we can start sending your rewards. And if you have any friends or family who are interested in getting a Jolt Sensor but missed the Kickstarter, we now have open pre-orders on our website that will be manufactured in the same batch as the Kickstarter orders.

Thank you to everyone for your continued support. As always, don't hesitate to reach out to us with any questions, comments, or concerns that you have. Any feedback is good feedback!
