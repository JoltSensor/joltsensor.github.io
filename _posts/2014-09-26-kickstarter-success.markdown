We're thrilled to announce the successful completion of [our Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2098685356/jolt-sensor-better-concussion-detection-for-youth). The last 31 days have been a whirlwind. It was a bit of a grind, but around dinner time last night we finally passed our $60,000 goal, just hours ahead of this morning's deadline. Simply put, this has been a humbling experience. Without the outpouring of support by friends, family, and complete strangers, we would not be where we are. We're excited for the coming months, as we double down our efforts to bring the Jolt Sensor to market. With its successful funding, we will now be setting upon the task of selecting manufacturers and suppliers, setting up tooling, and beginning to produce production quality prototypes of the Jolt Sensor before we begin delivering units to our backers.

Even though the Kickstarter has ended, we will continue to accept pre-orders, now through our website (check out the "Order Now" button in the header). Don't hesitate to continue to share our product and our vision with everyone that you know who could benefit from it. If there's one thing our campaign has shown, it's that the demand is there for a product like ours, and we want to ensure we can serve as many families (and athletes) in need as we can with our initial production run. Our Kickstarter backers will remain our first priority as we strive to meet, and even exceed, our predicted delivery dates. Pre-orders from the site will be queued up behind those orders on a first-come, first-served basis, with anticipated delivery in the month following delivery to our last Kickstarter backers.

Words cannot describe how appreciative we are for the support we've received, and our excitement to make good on the belief and trust that each and every one of our backers has placed in us. Moving forward, we will actively chronicle the process that goes into fulfilling our Kickstarter orders, and we look forward to putting together a much more detailed analysis of our Kickstarter campaign that we hope can serve as a resource for those considering taking the crowdfunding plunge.
