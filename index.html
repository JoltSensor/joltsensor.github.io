      <h1>Jolt solves the biggest problem.</h1>
      <p>At least 3.1 million school-aged athletes will be diagnosed with concussions this year. But considering up to 80% of concussions go undiagnosed, the real number is staggeringly higher. The truth is, most of the time, players don't know they've taken a bad hit. While no sports product can prevent a concussion, Jolt solves the biggest problem we face with sports concussions - you can't treat or look for symptoms if you don't know a player has had an impact. Now you can, with Jolt Sensor.</p>
