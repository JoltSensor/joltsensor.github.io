      <p>
        Jolt began as an engineering lab project at MIT, after one of our founders suffered a rather severe concussion at wrestling practice. It's a concussion that was made worse by the fact that it wasn't immediately recognized, exposing his brain to additional impacts (and injury) when it was most vulnerable. This is a common problem for athletes of all ages. Many of their own head injuries go unnoticed or are recognized too late, leading to numerous short and long term health consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jolt is on a mission to help athletes train smarter and safer through innovative technology solutions. We aim to provide highly-functional and intuitive products that provide athletes, parents, and coaches real-time feedback, and enable them to make smarter more timely decisions.

      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        Our team of athletic engineers has a broad range of skills and expertise, including multiple engineering degrees from MIT and experience working everywhere from venture-backed startups to some of the world's largest consumer packaged goods companies. Additionally, we have benefitted from the invaluable mentoring and support of countless groups and individuals, a few of which we would like to mention here.

      <h2>Our Operations</h2>
      <p>
        We source all of our components from American distributors, and manufacture and assemble all of our circuit boards in the United States. When we moved to St. Louis, the community welcomed us with open arms, and we're proud to say that the St. Louis area is our manufacturing headquarters, with enclosure manufacturing, assembly, packaging, warehousing, and shipping facilities all located in Missouri within 45 minutes of The Gateway Arch.
