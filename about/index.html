      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Jolt began as an engineering lab project at MIT, after one of our founders suffered a rather severe concussion at wrestling practice. It's a concussion that was made worse by the fact that it wasn't immediately recognized, exposing his brain to additional impacts (and injury) when it was most vulnerable. This is a common problem for athletes of all ages. Many of their own head injuries go unnoticed or are recognized too late, leading to numerous short and long term health consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jolt is on a mission to help athletes train smarter and safer through innovative technology solutions. We aim to provide highly-functional and intuitive products that provide athletes, parents, and coaches real-time feedback, and enable them to make smarter more timely decisions.
