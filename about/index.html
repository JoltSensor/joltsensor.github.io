        <h2>It's time to play smarter.</h2>
        <p>Jolt was born out of necessity after founder Ben Harvatine suffered a bad concussion at wrestling practice during his junior year at MIT. His initial injury went unnoticed and was made worse by additional impacts. Through multiple hospitalizations and a long painful recovery process, he wondered how he could've caught his injury sooner. The following semester he wired up his wrestling headgear with sensors for an engineering lab class and headed back to the mat determined to develop a solution that would prevent others from suffering the same experience.</p>
        <p>Jolt is on a mission to help athletes train smarter and safer through innovative technology solutions. We aim to provide highly-functional and intuitive products that provide athletes, parents, and coaches real-time feedback, and enable them to make smarter more timely decisions.</p>
