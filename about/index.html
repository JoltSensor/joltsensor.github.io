  <p>Jolt is dedicated to ensuring that each and every youth athlete receives proper care immediately following a sports-related brain injury. We aim to provide highly-functional and intuitive products that enable parents and coaches to monitor the health of their children and act decisively in the moments following an injury.</p>
  <p>Ben, our Founder & CEO, began work on Jolt at MIT as an undergraduate, following his own rather severe concussion. It's a concussion that was made worse by the fact that it wasn't immediately recognized as one, exposing his brain to additional dangerous impacts when it was most vulnerable. This is a common problem for over thirty million youth athletes in the United States. Many of their own dangerous head impacts also go unnoticed and undiagnosed, leading to numerous short and long-term health consequences.</p>
  <p>This is a problem that Jolt solves through a wearable impact sensor. By objectively quantifying the number and severity of head impacts experienced by athletes, parents and coaches can monitor their children in real time, to ensure that they never miss a dangerous impact.</br></br></p>
